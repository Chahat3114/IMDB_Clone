# IMDB Clone

This is a project to create a clone of the popular movie and TV show database website IMDb (Internet Movie Database) using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The project aims to replicate the core functionality and features of IMDb, allowing users to browse and search for movies, TV shows, actors, and more using APIs.

## Features

- *Movie and TV Show Information*: Users can browse and search for movies and TV shows. The application will fetch data from APIs to display details such as title, release year, genre, rating, cast, and plot summary.
- *Actor Information*: Users can search for actors and view their bio, filmography, and related information using API data.
- *User Reviews and Ratings*: Users can rate and review movies and TV shows. The application can store and display user reviews locally.
- *User Accounts*: Users can create accounts, log in, and manage their profile information. Account management can be handled using local storage or any other client-side storage mechanism.
- *Watchlist*: Users can add movies and TV shows to their watchlist for future reference. The watchlist can be stored locally.
- *Responsive Design*: The application should be designed responsively to ensure compatibility with various devices and screen sizes.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/imdb-clone.git
   

2. Open the project directory:

   bash
   cd imdb-clone
   

3. Start a local development server. You can use tools like Live Server or Python's built-in `http.server` module to serve the files locally.

4. Open your web browser and visit the local development server URL to access the application.

## Usage

- The home page displays a list of popular movies and TV shows fetched from the API.
- Users can search for movies, TV shows, and actors using the search functionality. The application will make API requests to retrieve the relevant data.
- Clicking on a movie or TV show will navigate to a details page, displaying its information retrieved from the API.
- Users can register an account to rate movies, write reviews, and add movies/shows to their watchlist. User account management can be handled using local storage or any other client-side storage mechanism.
- Users can add movies/shows to their watchlist, and the information can be stored locally.
- User reviews and ratings can be submitted and displayed locally.
